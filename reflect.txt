1. we have to deallocate memory of elements in the vector?
The responsibility of vector is not included deallocate memory, we have to take care of that process.
2. For error handling in loadData() function, i use a try catch to control messy data. I think beside
if/else, try catch is the best solution i have ever known so far.
3.We can not use list/vector of object type Vehicle, since our project implements this hierachy Vehicle->Car->Racecar,
It is the best practice to use list of pointer to type Vehicle like we always do in previous workshops to manage these
polymorphic object.
If we use list of object, Car and Racecar will be seperated into two list.
